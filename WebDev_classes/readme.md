# Demo Lesson 2
Unit 1: HTML and CSS basics
Topic: Classes

## Description:
In this lesson, students will be interested in styling with classes. They will learn the vocabulary, concepts, syntax and structure of the code, and apply it to create their own pixel art pieces by coloring specific table cells. Prior to this lesson, they should have a decent understanding of tables, and adding background colors in css.

## Schedule:
1. [Warm-Up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lCSdmiqoUnRCdQJT9vvtsqVcFLmXaaCiRZYm49OfI7o/edit?usp=sharing): students will choose their own colors, fill in the color legend, and color the table cells based on the legend. This will illustrate the idea of labeling each cell with a specific class, which dicatates its color.
2. [Mini-lesson](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LCcAGrwsIikStdkqp_ZitPXTez8fA_m2Ar9eNmDA55E/edit?usp=sharing): Review syntax and structure of classes. Explain its purpose and how to code with it. Review what punctuation is required for a class and where to write the class name. The class name can be any name they chose, though usually it should be something relevant. Demonstrate a brief code-along with the activity.
3. [Activity](https://replit.com/@yenminyoung/Pixel-Art-Template): Students will create [pixel art](https://pixel-art-example.yenminyoung.repl.co/) by adding a class to specific cells and styling them with the right color. They have a 4x4 and a 6x6 grid to complete. They must have at least 4 different colors in each box. They can make patterns, gradients, or pictures. If they wish, they can also add more columns and rows.
4. Wrap-Up: Showcase studetts work if they volunteer.
